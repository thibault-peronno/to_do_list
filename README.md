# TO DO LIST
For my exeman as "Concepteur et d√©veloppeur d'applications", I decided myself to create an web site about to do list.

This actual project is about to improve my skilss in API development. I develop this API with Node.Js et Express.JS without ORM.

The API is online at this adress 
https://api-to-do-list.thibault-peronno.fr/api

I used docker to put the service online. I create a Nginx server too. Again to improve my skills, but also learn Nginx.

In this Docker, I have the API, an MySQL Database and Adminer to manage the database.

The project about the interface is at this adress on GitHub. You will find more informations.
